# VB.NET Collections

## Arrays
- Arrays are a homogenous collection of items stored in a contiguous memory space
- Declare arrays by including () after the variable name
- Fun Fact: VB Arrays are zero-indexed
- Problem is, Arrays are statically sized

## Lists
- Lists are an ordered, homogenous collection of items
- Like arrays, they are also zero-indexed, but you can add/remove elements whenever

## Dictionaries
- A Dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs
- You access these values based on their keys, not based on index
