# HackerRank - Migratory Birds

Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.

**Example**

`arr = [1,1,2,2,3]`

There are two each of types 1 and 2, and one sighting of type 3. Pick the lower of the two types seen twice: type 1.

**Input Format**

The first input must be an integer entered into the console, *n*, the size of *arr*. The second input describes *arr* as *n* integers, each representing a type number of the sighted bird. Each will be entered into the console one after another.
